\begin{abstract}
To explore the relationship between information's disseminating speed and its inherent value, make clear the revolution of methodology, purpose, and functionality of society's networks, we design some models based on a consideration of 5 periods: 1870s (Newspapers and Telegraph Age), 1920s (Radios Age), 1970s (Televisions Age), 1990s (Early Internet Age) and 2010s (Mobile Internet Age).
\par To analyze the relationship between speed/flow of information versus inherent value of information of 5 periods and solve all problems, we should firstly know the basic definitions of "What is 'News'?","How to judge 'Value'?" and "How to judge 'Impact'?"Then, we divide our discussion into three parts: mode the dissemination, explore the development of dissemination and discuss the influence of the information network. Specifically, we firstly use the SW Model and BA Model. Then, we analysis the two models and combine them with some notions(parallel, self-studying) from Neural Networks into a modified model. After that, we discuss the filter modify the model again. This is the basis for our further work. In the second part, we consider the network should be multivariable,thus three models are made: a prediction model inspired by the logistic model, the GM(1,n) Model and the BP model. We combine them again, using the Grey Model GM(1,n) to predict a total growth, then putting the data into a BA function based on logistic learning curve. Some data is used as validating the model, and some predictions are generated by the model. Some measurements have been made, but unfortunately, they seem don't work. In the next part, we analysis the factors that change public interest and opinion, and model how to change it. Three models are applied to this part, a principal component analysis (PCA) model to the first problem, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) ,a graphic model to the second problem. Different analysis method reveals different facet of a problem, thus we no longer combine these methods.
\par In the last of this essay, we answer some "What if" problems and analysis the strengthens and weakness of all models. The references and appendices are follow.
